      <p class="about-text">
      Breeze is a three-year-old Golden Retriever.
      Her favorite toys include squeeky toys, tennis balls, and bones.
      Some of her past-times include swimming, running, and eating.

    One time I took my dog on a walk.
    While we were walking, she broke off the leesh and went for a swim.
    While in the water, she spotted some ducks.
    When she tried to chase the ducks, they quickly flew away.

        Here is a photo of my dog eating icecream. She is eating vanilla icecream, because dogs can not eat chocolate.

        Here is a photo of my dog chewing on a bone. Aside from tennis balls, she loves bones because they taste good. Well, at least to her they do.

        Thank you for visiting my website to learn more about my dog. She is the best dog in the world, but my opinion's biased.
